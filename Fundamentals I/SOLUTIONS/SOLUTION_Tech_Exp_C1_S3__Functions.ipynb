integration, interpolation, and much more.\n","We will not look closely at Scipy today, but we will use its functionality later in the course.\n","\n","#### [``pandas``](http://pandas.pydata.org/):

very familiar.\n","\n","#### [``matplotlib``](http://matplotlib.org): Visualization in Python\n","\n","Matplotlib started out as a Matlab plotting clone in Python, and has grown from there in the 15 years since its creation.
